My name is Mickael Lokhate, I created this program in C++ with the SFML (for persons who want to know ^^), and I have done that who serves for graphics :p with photoshop and inkscape.

The music in game : "Debardage" was wrote by Mr. Alban Lepsy, you can go watch his website : http://alban.lepsy.free.fr/

If you want to have the program sources, ask me something, tell me something about the program... you can contact me :
